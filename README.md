Final project: School Bus routing Problem

Objective: The aim of this problem is to apply VRP, clustering and
ACO as a Meta-heuristic.

Tasks:

1.- Assigning students to bus:
	Problems:
		- Each student that has the right to be transported
			to its school, also has the right to a bus stop 
			located at a distance of less than 750 meters from 
			its residence (6 meters as a example).

		- At the end of the init method we have a map structure
			that maps the id of each stop to the set of
			students assigned to that stop bus.
